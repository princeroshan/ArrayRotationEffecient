# ArrayRotationEffecient
Less Time Array Rotation
No TLE Issue

Input:
1
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
Output:
4 5 1 2 3
Here T is 1, which means one test case.
N=5 denoting the number of elements in the array and K=2 , denoting the number of steps of rotations.
The initial array is: 
In first rotation, 5 will come in the first position and all other elements will move to one position ahead from their current position. 
Now, the resultant array will be 51234
In second rotation, 4 will come in the first position and all other elements will move to one position ahead from their current position. 
Now, the resultant array will be 45123
